# Task-Management-app
This is a simple HTML-based task management app that allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks. The app includes a form to add tasks and a list of existing tasks with checkboxes, edit buttons, and delete buttons.

Future Improvements:
While this app is functional, there are several improvements that could be made in the future to enhance its functionality and usability. Here are a few ideas:
Add CSS to style the app and make it more visually appealing.
Use JavaScript to add interactivity, such as the ability to drag and drop tasks to reorder them.
Add the ability to categorize tasks by project or context.
Allow users to set reminders or notifications for upcoming tasks.
Implement user authentication and authorization to allow multiple users to use the app and manage their own tasks.
